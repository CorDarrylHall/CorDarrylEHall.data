## About Me

As a Business Analyst and Program Manager, I am seeking new opportunities in Program Management where I can leverage my expertise in data analytics to provide strategic insights. My extensive experience includes serving as an Operations Program Manager, where I successfully led multi-disciplinary projects, coordinated stakeholders, and drove operational excellence. I have effectively managed the execution of strategic engineering objectives using tools such as Smartsheet and Lucid Planner, resulting in significant achievements like increasing Intel NUC device production from \$4 million to \$6 million over 10 years and orchestrating collaboration among 13 cross-functional teams to achieve a 27% revenue increase over three quarters. At Lam Research, I excelled in leading technical collaborations that resulted in a new contract management system and optimizing workflows to enhance business efficacy by 44%.

In my roles, I have showcased my proficiency in managing intricate compensation data processes and reporting at both Lam Research and Intel Corporation. I utilized tools like Power BI and Tableau and developed dashboards using languages such as R, Python, and SQL. As a Program Manager at Intel, I led a team to achieve record-breaking milestones in product introductions. My background also includes serving in the United States Navy, where I managed extensive equipment inventories and led multiple deployments. Additionally, I hold an MBA from Willamette University, where I consulted for the Boys & Girls Club, saving them over \$500K.

I am enthusiastic about discussing how I can contribute to your company's success and look forward to potential collaborations.
